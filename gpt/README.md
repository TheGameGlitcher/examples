To contribute edit the `character.json` file

**Note:** The reason why the `character.json` uses gpt3 and gpt4 instead of just 1 gpt in the json is because if you're using gpt4, it does a far better job at interpreting what you want but when using gpt3, you need to be way more specific. You'll be using more tokens than you need when using gpt4 if you use the same gpt3 prompt. Currently they're both the same because the instructions are basic & short enough to where they'll both perform fine but if someone makes a contribution to the prompt that asks way more, it's here for that.
